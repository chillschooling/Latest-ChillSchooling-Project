        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          "Who Did Patrick's Homework?" is a story about a boy named Patrick who dislikes homework and loves playing outdoor games like hockey and basketball. His teachers warn him to complete his work, but he finds it boring.

          One day, Patrick finds his cat playing with what he thinks is a doll. He discovers it's a tiny man, an elf, who is scared of the cat. The elf promises to grant Patrick a wish if he saves him. Patrick, feeling lucky, asks the elf to do his homework for the entire semester, which is 35 days.

          The elf agrees but soon runs into problems. He doesn't know anything about math, English, or history. He constantly asks Patrick for help, saying "Help me! Help me!". Patrick has to bring books from the library, look up words in the dictionary, and guide the elf with his schoolwork.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the end of the semester, the homework is done, and the elf leaves. Patrick gets an 'A' grade in all his subjects. His classmates are amazed, his teachers are full of praise, and his parents are proud of his newfound diligence. Patrick becomes a model student who is hardworking and cheerful.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, Patrick believes the elf did all his homework. However, the secret is that Patrick did it all himself. The elf just provided the motivation for Patrick to work hard and discover his own abilities.

          The central theme of the story is the importance of <strong>self-help and hard work</strong>. The story teaches that success is not achieved through magic or shortcuts, but through one's own effort and perseverance.
