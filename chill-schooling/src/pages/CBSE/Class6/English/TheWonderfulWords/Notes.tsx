      <h1>Poem: The Wonderful Words</h1>

      <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The poem "The Wonderful Words" by Mary O'Neill emphasizes the significance of language and the power of words in expressing thoughts and ideas. It highlights that every mind is full of thoughts and ideas that should not be allowed to "shrivel and die" due to a lack of expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          The poem encourages everyone to find the right words to articulate their thoughts clearly and beautifully. It describes English as a "wonderful game" that anyone can play to match words with their brightest ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Words are presented as the "food and dress of thought," giving thoughts form, vitality, and movement, and freeing them from the "prison" of the mind. The poem suggests that many beautiful and fresh ideas remain unsaid because people haven't yet found the appropriate words to convey them.

        <h2>Characters (Abstract Concepts)</h2>
        <p>
          The poem does not feature traditional human characters. Instead, the main "characters" or entities are abstract concepts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Words:</strong> Portrayed as powerful tools that give life, structure, and beauty to thoughts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Thoughts/Ideas:</strong> Described as being "trapped" or "imprisoned" within the mind until they are expressed through words.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Poet (Mary O'Neill):</strong> The speaker who conveys the message about the importance of words.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>The Reader/Everyone:</strong> The audience encouraged to master language and express their unique thoughts.
          </li>
        </ul>
