        <h2>The Harappan Civilization</h2>
        <p>
          The story of the Harappan Civilisation (also known as the Indus Valley Civilisation) began about 150 years ago, when railway lines were being laid down for the first time in Punjab. Engineers stumbled upon the site of Harappa in present-day Pakistan. They found a mound of high-quality bricks and used them to build railway lines, unknowingly destroying much of the ancient city.

          <h4>Did You Know?</h4>
          <p>The Harappan Civilisation is one of the world's earliest urban civilisations, flourishing around 4700 years ago.</p>

        <h2>Features of Harappan Cities</h2>
        <p>
          Many of these cities were divided into two or more parts. Usually, the part to the west was smaller but higher and was called the citadel. The part to the east was larger but lower and was called the lower town.
        </p>
        <h3>Great Bath:</h3>
        <p>
          In cities like Mohenjodaro, a very special tank, which archaeologists call the Great Bath, was built. This was lined with bricks, coated with plaster, and made watertight with a layer of natural tar. Water was probably brought in from a well, and drained out after use.
        </p>
        <h3>Granaries:</h3>
        <p>
          Some cities had elaborate storehouses or granaries, where grains were stored.
        </p>
        <h3>Drainage System:</h3>
        <p>
          Many of these cities had a very impressive drainage system. Drains were covered, and had gentle slopes so that water could flow through them. In some cases, houses, drains and streets were probably planned and built at the same time.
        </p>

        <h2>Life in the Harappan Cities</h2>
        <p>
          Harappan cities were busy places. Rulers planned the construction of special buildings in the city. Scribes, who knew how to write, helped prepare the seals, and perhaps wrote on other materials that have not survived. Craftspersons made all kinds of things.
        </p>
        <h3>Crafts and Raw Materials:</h3>
        <p>
          People made objects of stone, shell, and metal (copper, bronze, gold, and silver). Copper and bronze were used to make tools, weapons, ornaments, and vessels. Gold and silver were used to make ornaments and vessels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Harappans also made seals out of stone. These are generally rectangular and usually have an animal carved on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          They also made terracotta toys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Raw materials were either available locally or imported from distant places. For example, copper may have been imported from Rajasthan, and even from Oman in West Asia. Gold could have come from Karnataka, and precious stones from Gujarat, Iran, and Afghanistan.

        <div className="memory-trick">
          <h4>Memory Trick!</h4>
          <p>Think of the Harappans as skilled builders and artisans, with a well-organized society!</p>

      <section id="food-and-farming">
        <h2>Food and Farming</h2>
        <p>
          People in the cities lived in the countryside and grew crops like wheat, barley, pulses, peas, rice, sesame, linseed, and mustard. A new tool, the plough, was used to dig the earth for turning the soil and planting seeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Animals like cattle, sheep, goat, and buffalo were reared. Water was stored and supplied to the fields when needed.
        </p>

      <section id="the-end-of-the-civilization">
        <h2>The End of the Civilization</h2>
        <p>
          Around 3900 years ago, we find the beginning of a major change. People stopped living in many of the cities. Writing, seals, and weights were no longer used. Raw materials brought from long distances became rare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Archaeologists suggest several reasons for this decline:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rivers dried up.</li>
          <li>Deforestation.</li>
          <li>Floods.</li>
          <li>Rulers lost control.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          However, the exact cause of the end of the Harappan Civilisation remains a mystery.
