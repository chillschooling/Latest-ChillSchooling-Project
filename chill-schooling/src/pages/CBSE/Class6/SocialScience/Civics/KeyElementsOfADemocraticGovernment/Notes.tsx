      <h1>Chapter 4: Key Elements of a Democratic Government</h1>

      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Participation</h2>
        <p>
          Peopleâ€™s participation is the most important element of a democratic government. People participate in the governance of the country through elections. They vote to elect their representatives, who then form the government.
        </p>
        <div className="did-you-know">
          <h4>Did You Know?</h4>
          <p>In a democracy, people have the right to express their views and protest against the government's decisions if they disagree.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="other-ways-of-participation">
        <h2>Other Ways of Participation</h2>
        <p>
          People participate in other ways too. They take an interest in the working of the government and express their approval or disapproval.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rallies and Demonstrations:</strong> People organise rallies, demonstrations, and signature campaigns to express their views.</li>
          <li><strong>Media:</strong> Newspapers, magazines, TV, and social media play a crucial role in informing people about government policies and actions.</li>
          <li><strong>Public Meetings:</strong> People attend public meetings to discuss issues and voice their opinions.</li>
        </ul>
        <div className="example-box">
          <h4>Example:</h4>
          <p>If the government proposes a new law that people disagree with, they can organise a peaceful protest march to show their opposition.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="need-to-resolve-conflict">
        <h2>Need to Resolve Conflict</h2>
        <p>
          In a diverse country like India, conflicts can arise due to differences in culture, religion, region, or economic backgrounds. The government plays a crucial role in resolving these conflicts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The government's role is to ensure that all citizens are treated equally and that justice is served. The police and the courts are important institutions for resolving conflicts.
        </p>
        <div className="memory-trick">
          <h4>Memory Trick!</h4>
          <p>Democracy = Dialogue + Justice! Conflicts are resolved through discussion and fair decisions.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="equality-and-justice">
        <h2>Equality and Justice</h2>
        <p>
          Equality and justice are inseparable in a democracy. The government is committed to ensuring equality for all its citizens.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Laws:</strong> Laws are made to ensure that no one is discriminated against on the basis of caste, religion, gender, or economic status.</li>
          <li><strong>Special Provisions:</strong> The government also makes special provisions for disadvantaged groups to ensure that they have equal opportunities. For example, reservations in education and jobs.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Indian Constitution guarantees equality to all citizens and prohibits discrimination.
