Distance:</h3>\n        <p>\n          Maps are drawings, which reduce the entire world or a part of it to fit on a sheet of paper. This reduction is done with the help of a scale.

Symbols:</h3>\n        <p>\n          It is not possible to draw on a map the actual shape and size of different features like buildings, roads, bridges, trees, railway lines or a well. So, they are shown by using certain letters, shades, colours, pictures and lines. These symbols give a lot of information in a limited space.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          With the use of these symbols, maps can be drawn easily and are simple to read.
