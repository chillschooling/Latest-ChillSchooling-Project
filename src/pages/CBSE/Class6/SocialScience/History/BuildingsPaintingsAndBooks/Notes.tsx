        <h2>Buildings: Stupas and Temples</h2>
        <h3>Stupas:</h3>
        <p>
          Stupas are mounds where the relics of the Buddha or his followers were placed. These were usually built of stone or brick. The Great Stupa at Sanchi is one of the most famous stupas.
        </p>
        <h3>Temples:</h3>
        <p>
          Temples were built to house images of gods and goddesses. Some of the earliest temples were simple structures, but over time, they became more elaborate. The garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum) was the most important part of the temple, where the image of the main deity was placed.

        <h2>Paintings: Ajanta Caves</h2>
        <p>
          The Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra are famous for their rock-cut caves and exquisite paintings. These paintings, mostly depicting stories from the Jataka tales (stories about the previous births of the Buddha), were done using natural colours.

      <section id="books">
        <h2>Books: Epics and Puranas</h2>
        <p>
          Ancient India produced a rich body of literature, including epics, Puranas, and scientific treatises.
        </p>
        <h3>Epics:</h3>
        <p>
          The Ramayana and the Mahabharata are two great Sanskrit epics. The Mahabharata is about a war fought between the Kauravas and Pandavas. The Ramayana is about Rama, a prince of Kosala, who was exiled and had to fight to rescue his wife Sita.
        </p>
        <h3>Puranas:</h3>
        <p>
          Puranas literally mean 'old'. They contain stories about gods and goddesses such as Vishnu, Shiva, Durga, or Parvati. They were written in simple Sanskrit so that everyone could understand them.
        </p>
        <h3>Scientific Books:</h3>
        <p>
          Aryabhata, a great mathematician and astronomer, wrote the Aryabhatiyam. He stated that day and night were caused by the Earthâ€™s rotation on its axis. He also developed a scientific explanation for eclipses.
