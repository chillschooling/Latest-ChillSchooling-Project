        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The poem "Beauty" by E-Yeh-Shure explores the idea that beauty is not just something seen, but also something heard and felt, existing all around us and within ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first stanza describes beauty that can be seen during the day, such as in the sunlight, trees, birds, growing corn, and people working or dancing for their harvest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second stanza highlights beauty that can be heard at night, like the sighing wind, falling rain, or a singer's earnest song.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third stanza emphasizes that beauty is also within oneself, found in good deeds, happy thoughts, dreams, work, and even in rest. The poem concludes that beauty is present everywhere, and it is our perception and attitude that allow us to experience it.
