        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The story "How The Dog Found Himself A New Master" is a fable explaining the domestication of dogs. It begins with a dog tired of being wild and constantly searching for food, deciding to find the strongest creature on Earth to serve.
        </p>
        <p>
          His search leads him to a wolf, but the wolf fears a bear. So, the dog chooses the bear, who then fears a lion. The dog then serves the lion, the strongest beast in the forest. However, the lion, in turn, fears man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Realizing that man is even stronger than the mighty lion, the dog leaves the lion and chooses man as his final master. Since then, the dog has remained man's most loyal servant, serving him faithfully to this day.
