      <h1>Poem: Where Do All The Teachers Go?</h1>

      <section id="summary">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The poem "Where Do All The Teachers Go?" by Peter Dixon is narrated from the perspective of a curious child. The child wonders about the lives of teachers outside of school, particularly after the school day ends at four o'clock.
        </p>
        <p>
          The child's innocent questions include whether teachers live in ordinary houses, wear pajamas, wash their socks, watch TV, or even pick their noses, just like regular people. The child also ponders if teachers ever had parents, were naughty as children, made spelling mistakes, got punished, lost books, scribbled on desks, or wore dirty jeans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unable to reconcile the image of perfect teachers with the idea of them doing everyday things, the child decides to follow one teacher home to discover the truth. The ultimate goal is to write a poem about these discoveries, which the teachers can then read to other students.

        <h2>Themes and Moral</h2>
        <p>
          The poem highlights <strong>Childhood Curiosity and Innocence</strong>, reflecting a child's natural questions about the adult world.
        </p>
        <p>
          A central theme is <strong>Perception vs. Reality</strong>, contrasting how children perceive teachers with the reality of their ordinary lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The child's questions reflect a broader wonder about the <strong>Mystery of Adulthood</strong> and if adults were ever like them.

        <p>
          Finally, it conveys a sense of <strong>Admiration for Teachers</strong>.
